N.B. Compared to the original protobuf file, this has been slightly edited - 
ref_nuc and mut_nuc are repeated fields (to allow multi-symbol insertions and deletions).
Additionally, nucleotides are encoded in nucleotide order (A=0,C=1,G=2,T=3) plus 
the empty dash symbol -=-1.

The position -1 is also allowed - this represents the very start of the genome, and
another index 'insertion_position' has been added. This is 0 (or omitted) if the mutation happened
on the base genome, but in situations where a mutation happened on an insert then this
index is a pointer to that insert.
